# Jeb's Portfolio Evaluations - February 16, 2026

Son, you asked me to take a hard look at four of your holdings. I've done my homework, crunched the numbers, and here's what I see. No sugar-coating, just the facts and my 40 years of experience talking.

## HOOD (Robinhood) — Jeb's Take

**The Business:** Robinhood runs a commission-free trading platform for retail investors. They make money three ways: payment for order flow on trades, net interest spreads on customer cash, and subscription fees for their premium Gold service. It's basically a casino that doesn't charge an entrance fee but takes a cut of every bet.

**The Numbers:**
- Revenue: $2.95B (up 58% from 2023)
- Net Income: $1.41B (turned from -$541M loss in 2023)
- Q4 Revenue: $1.01B (up 115% YoY)
- Customer Growth: 25.2M funded customers, $193B assets under custody
- Current Price: ~$20-30 range | Valuation: Actually profitable now

**The Moat:** Network effects and low-cost structure. Once retail traders are on the platform, switching costs are real (tax implications, familiarity, integrated features). Their zero-commission model forced the entire industry to follow suit.

**The Risks:** Regulatory crackdown on payment for order flow, market downturn crushing trading volumes, competition from established players with deeper pockets, crypto volatility affecting transaction revenues.

**The Verdict:** HOLD 
- Finally turned the corner to sustained profitability 
- Fair value estimate: $25-35
- Margin of safety: 15-25% at current levels

**Jeb's Color:** This used to be a cash-burning meme stock, but management finally figured out how to turn hype into profits. The numbers don't lie anymore - they're making real money. Still depends too much on market volatility for my taste, but it's no longer a speculation play.

## LAC (Lithium Americas) — Jeb's Take

**The Business:** Lithium Americas is developing the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada. They dig lithium out of the ground to feed the electric vehicle battery boom. Problem is, they're not digging anything yet - still in the development phase burning cash while they build the mine.

**The Numbers:**
- Revenue: $0 (pre-revenue development company)
- Net Income: Increasing losses due to development costs and transaction expenses
- Assets: Secured $2.26B DOE loan for Phase 1 construction
- Production Target: 40,000 tonnes per year of lithium carbonate when operational
- Current Price: $10-15 range | Valuation: Speculative development premium

**The Moat:** Thacker Pass is one of the largest known lithium deposits in North America. When built, it'll have scale advantages and proximity to battery manufacturers. Government backing through the DOE loan provides financing security.

**The Risks:** Commodity price volatility, execution risk on a massive construction project, environmental permitting delays, lithium oversupply as new mines come online globally, technology risk if battery chemistry shifts away from lithium.

**The Verdict:** PASS
- Too much execution risk for my blood
- Fair value estimate: Impossible to calculate on pre-revenue development
- Margin of safety: None - pure speculation

**Jeb's Color:** Son, I've seen this movie before with mining companies. Big promises, bigger holes in the ground, and investors left holding the bag when commodity prices tank. The DOE loan helps, but this is still a bet on lithium prices staying high and flawless execution. That's not investing, that's gambling.

## ET (Energy Transfer) — Jeb's Take

**The Business:** Energy Transfer owns and operates a massive network of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids pipelines across America. They're a toll booth on the energy highway - producers pay them to move products from Point A to Point B. It's a beautiful business model when you own the pipes.

**The Numbers:**
- Revenue: $82.67B (up 5% from 2023)
- Adjusted EBITDA: $15.5B (up 13% YoY)
- Distributable Cash Flow: $8.4B (up 10% YoY)
- Growth Capex: $5B planned for 2025
- Current Price: $16-18 range | Valuation: ~9-10x EBITDA, 8% distribution yield

**The Moat:** Once you build a pipeline, it's nearly impossible to replicate. Massive regulatory barriers, decades-long contracts, and natural monopoly characteristics. They own critical infrastructure that America needs to function.

**The Risks:** Environmental regulations restricting new pipeline construction, renewable energy reducing long-term demand, pipeline accidents creating liability, interest rate sensitivity due to high capital intensity.

**The Verdict:** BUY
- Infrastructure monopoly with pricing power
- Fair value estimate: $22-26
- Margin of safety: 25-35% at current levels

**Jeb's Color:** Now this is what I'm talking about. Real assets, real cash flows, and a management team that knows how to allocate capital. The data center boom is driving natural gas demand through the roof, and they're perfectly positioned to benefit. This is the kind of boring, profitable business that makes fortunes over decades.

## CVNA (Carvana) — Jeb's Take

**The Business:** Carvana sells used cars online and delivers them to your driveway. They buy cars at auction, recondition them, photograph them in 360-degree detail, and sell them through their website. Think Amazon for used cars, complete with those ridiculous car vending machines.

**The Numbers:**
- Revenue: $13.67B (up 27% from 2023)
- Net Income: $404M (turned from losses to profit)
- Q4 Revenue: $3.55B (up 46% YoY)
- Units Sold: 416K vehicles (up 33% YoY)
- Gross Profit Per Unit: $6,908 (up from $5,533 in 2023)
- Current Price: ~$280 range | Valuation: ~20x earnings, 10% EBITDA margin

**The Moat:** Brand recognition in online car sales, logistics network, reconditioning facilities, and customer experience advantages. Hard to replicate the infrastructure they've built, but not impossible.

**The Risks:** Economic downturn crushing used car demand, competition from traditional dealers going digital, inventory management in a cyclical business, high fixed costs creating operating leverage both ways.

**The Verdict:** HOLD
- Finally achieved sustainable profitability but richly valued
- Fair value estimate: $200-250
- Margin of safety: Minimal at current prices

**Jeb's Color:** Credit where credit's due - they figured out how to make money after years of burning cash. But at $280 a share, you're paying for perfection. Used car sales are cyclical, and when the next recession hits, people keep their clunkers longer. The business model works, but the price assumes nothing ever goes wrong.

## Final Thoughts

Jon, out of these four holdings, ET is the only one I'd be adding to today. HOOD and CVNA have turned the corner on profitability, which is good, but they're fairly valued at best. LAC is pure speculation dressed up as an investment.

If you're going to hold these, watch the quarterly numbers like a hawk. HOOD depends on trading volumes, CVNA on consumer spending, LAC on construction milestones, and ET just keeps churning out cash like the money machine it is.

The numbers don't lie, but they don't tell the whole story either. Keep your position sizes reasonable and remember - even good companies can be bad investments at the wrong price.
