# The IRL Trade: Live Sports & Events Investment Thesis

**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Thesis:** Secular tailwinds driving increased capital flows into live sports and experiences

---

## Investment Thesis Overview

Post-COVID revenge spending on experiences continues. Key drivers:
- **Sports betting legalization** expanding across 38+ US states ($160-170B projected 2025 legal wagers)
- **Streaming wars** driving up live sports rights costs (Apple F1 deal, Netflix NFL, etc.)
- **Global expansion** of US leagues (NFL in Germany/UK, NBA in Asia, F1 growth in Americas)
- **Scarcity premium** on live events as only remaining "appointment viewing"
- **Gen-Z preference** for experiences over goods

## Executive Summary

**The IRL Trade remains compelling, with sports betting and premium sports content ownership offering the best risk-adjusted returns.** Flutter (FLUT) is the highest conviction pick—largest scale, path to profitability, diversified globally, and trading near 52-week lows with 70%+ analyst upside. DraftKings (DKNG) offers similar exposure with higher risk/reward. TKO (UFC/WWE) provides defensive sports content exposure with 40%+ EBITDA margins and low beta. Formula One (FWONK) benefits from the Apple TV deal and US growth tailwinds. **Avoid or underweight Live Nation until DOJ antitrust resolution—the legal risk dominates the thesis despite strong operating fundamentals.** Several names are at or near attractive entry points now (FLUT, DKNG, MGM, MTN), making this an opportune time to build positions.
