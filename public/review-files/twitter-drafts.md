# Twitter Drafts

Content queue for @jonto21. Goal: 1 tweet/day (weekdays), longer post every 1-2 weeks.

## Voice & Topics

**Core themes:**
- Crypto/DeFi competence — showing real knowledge, not hype
- AI competence — practical use, not sci-fi speculation  
- Equities/traditional markets — bridging TradFi and crypto
- The convergence — crypto + TradFi + AI merging into one

**Style:**
- Dry humor ✓
- Not combative ✗
- Proof of work over engagement bait
- Building a public resume, not follower count
- Jon edits all drafts → I learn the voice over time

## Draft Queue

### Day 1 — The Setup (2026-01-26)

**Option A (casual):**
> Finally did the thing — set up an AI co-pilot to help manage my portfolio and trading research.
> 
> Day 1: mapped all my positions, tagged everything by sector, built a watchlist, and scheduled daily morning briefings.
> 
> Going to document how this goes. 🧵 incoming eventually.

**Option B (more specific):**
> Built an AI system today that:
> - Tracks my positions across Fidelity, E*Trade, and crypto
> - Monitors 6 Twitter accounts for alpha
> - Sends me a 6am daily briefing with movers, expirations, and sector news
> 
> Total setup time: ~1 hour. Let's see if it actually makes me a better trader.

**Option C (hook-y):**
> Everyone's talking about AI replacing traders.
> 
> I'm trying something different: AI as a trading *co-pilot*.
> 
> Day 1 report coming soon.

### Day 3 — Sub-Agents & Morning Briefings (2026-01-29)

**Option A (workflow focus):**
> Day 3 of the AI co-pilot experiment:
> 
> Woke up to a 6am briefing waiting in Telegram. Options expiring in 22 days flagged, winners/losers sorted, sector themes ranked.
> 
> Then I spawned 4 sub-agents overnight to deep-dive: AI sector, defense/drones, energy/nuclear, and AI+trading.
> 
> Cost optimization next — figured out how to route research tasks to Sonnet instead of Opus. Same quality for 1/15th the price.

**Option B (shorter):**
> AI trading co-pilot day 3:
> 
> Morning briefing delivered at 6am ✓
> Options expiration tracking ✓
> Spawned 4 overnight research agents on different sectors ✓
> 
> Next: reviewing the deep dives and giving feedback on format.

**Option C (hook):**
> My AI just did 8 hours of research while I slept.
> 
> 4 sector deep dives: AI, defense, energy, trading tools.
> 
> Now I'm reviewing the output over coffee. This is the future of solo research.

### Day 5 — Live Market Data & Mobile Dashboard (2026-01-30)

**Option A (technical win):**
> AI co-pilot day 5:
> 
> Built a real-time market data pipeline. Yahoo Finance → hourly refreshes during market hours → alerts if any position moves >5%.

> Also made the dashboard mobile-friendly. Collapsible sections, touch targets, the works.
> 
> Small wins compound.

**Option B (problem/solution):**
> Problem: My portfolio dashboard had 4-day-old prices.
> 
> Solution: 30 minutes with my AI co-pilot.
> 
> Now it pulls live quotes hourly, updates all positions automatically, and pings me if something moves big.
> 
> Free tier Yahoo Finance API. $0/month.

**Option C (builder angle):**
> The dream: wake up to fresh market data, not stale spreadsheets.
> 
> Today's build:
> - Hourly price refresh during market hours
> - Auto-calculated P/L across all positions
> - Mobile-responsive dashboard (finally readable on phone)
