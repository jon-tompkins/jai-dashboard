# Ant's Timing Analysis — February 16, 2026

*Pure price action read on four tickers. Structure doesn't lie.*

## HOOD — Ant's Read

**Current Setup:**
- Price: ~$73.50 (trading in $70.26-$77.08 range)
- Trend: Range-bound after earnings reaction
- Position in Range: Lower third, testing support

**Key Levels:**
- Resistance: $77.00, $84.00 (target level from some analyses)
- Support: $70.00, $65.00 (major breakdown level)
- Breakdown/Breakout Level: $77.00 up, $70.00 down

**Structure Analysis:**
Classic post-earnings disappointment setup. Beat EPS ($0.66 vs $0.63) but price rejected hard from the highs. This smells like distribution — news was good but smart money used the pop to sell. We're seeing that classic Wyckoff "good news, bad price action" divergence. The range is narrow but we're sitting in the lower third.

**Volume Read:**
Earnings spike likely came with heavy volume, but follow-through has been weak. Volume on decline suggests controlled selling rather than panic. This could be setting up for a spring (false break below $70) or genuine breakdown.

**The Setup:**
No clean setup here. If we break $70 with volume, that's distribution confirmed and we target $65-60 range. If we hold $70 and build a base, watch for volume expansion above $77 for the real move.

**Timing Verdict:** WAIT FOR CLARITY
Either the breakdown below $70 or reclaim above $77 with volume.

**Ant's Take:** Post-earnings action is ugly despite the beat. Let it show you what it wants to do.

## LAC — Ant's Read

**Current Setup:**
- Price: ~$4.65 (near key support zone)
- Trend: Downtrend with potential base building
- Position in Range: At critical support

**Key Levels:**
- Resistance: $4.77, $5.00
- Support: $4.40-$4.50 (major zone), $4.00 (breakdown)
- Breakdown/Breakout Level: $4.40 down, $4.80 up

**Structure Analysis:**
This is textbook Wyckoff accumulation territory. The $4.40-$4.50 zone has been tested multiple times and held. Old resistance from Oct/Nov 2024 has flipped to support — classic role reversal. Price is building a base right at this critical level. Lithium sector has been beaten down, creating potential cause for a significant effect move.

**Volume Read:**
Volume should be drying up if this is true accumulation. Look for expansion on any move above $4.80 to confirm smart money accumulation is complete.

**The Setup:**
This is a spring setup waiting to happen. If they push it below $4.40 to shake out weak hands, that could be the entry. Otherwise, buying the current level with stops below $4.30 and targeting $5.50+ on a breakout.

**Timing Verdict:** BUY ZONE
Current level offers good risk/reward. Stop below $4.30.

**Ant's Take:** Base building at support after a beating. This is where fortunes are made.

## ET — Ant's Read

**Current Setup:**
- Price: $18.75 (near recent highs)
- Trend: Uptrend, defensive rotation play
- Position in Range: Upper end of recent range

**Key Levels:**
- Resistance: $19.00, $19.22 (all-time high from Jan 2025)
- Support: $18.00, $17.50
- Breakdown/Breakout Level: $18.00 down, $19.25 up

**Structure Analysis:**
Clean uptrend structure with higher lows. Energy sector rotation is providing underlying bid. Price is testing the highs but hasn't shown real breakout power yet. This looks like a measured move targeting the old highs around $19.22. The base from lower levels provides the cause for this effect.

**Volume Read:**
Volume should expand on any break above $19.25. If volume is light up here, it could be a false breakout setting up.

**The Setup:**
Late in the move but still constructive. A pullback to $18.00-18.20 would offer better entry. Above $19.25 with volume targets $21+ based on the measured move principle.

**Timing Verdict:** WAIT FOR PULLBACK
Let it come back to $18.00-18.20 area for better entry.

**Ant's Take:** Good trend but chasing here. Let the defensive rotation bring it to you.

## CVNA — Ant's Read

**Current Setup:**
- Price: $343.50 (mid-range)
- Trend: Range-bound with overhead pressure
- Position in Range: Middle, facing earnings

**Key Levels:**
- Resistance: $351.15 (recent high), $363.69
- Support: $336.11 (recent low), $340.67
- Breakdown/Breakout Level: $335 down, $355 up

**Structure Analysis:**
Tight trading range with earnings February 18th approaching. The fact that it's holding this $335-355 range after massive prior moves suggests either accumulation or distribution. Given the high valuation (78 PE) and recent insider selling mentioned, this smells more like distribution.

**Volume Read:**
Volume patterns into earnings will be key. Heavy volume on any breakdown below $335 would confirm distribution phase complete.

**The Setup:**
This is a coin flip into earnings. Range is tight, implied volatility likely high. Better to wait for the reaction and trade the direction of the break.

**Timing Verdict:** AVOID UNTIL AFTER EARNINGS
Too much event risk, unclear structure.

**Ant's Take:** Earnings lottery ticket. I don't gamble — I read charts. Wait for the dust to settle.

## Summary — Ant's Market Read

**Clear Setups:** LAC (buy zone at support)
**Wait for Pullback:** ET (good trend, bad entry)
**Wait for Clarity:** HOOD (post-earnings confusion), CVNA (earnings risk)

The market is offering one clean setup (LAC) and three "wait for better" situations. That's normal. Good setups are rare. Most of the time, the right move is no move.

**Market Structure:** Mixed signals. Some accumulation (LAC), some distribution (HOOD), some trend continuation (ET), and some event uncertainty (CVNA). 

Patience beats rushing. The chart tells you when to act.
