## APO (Apollo Global) — Ant's Read

**Current Setup:**
- Price: ~$141-145
- Trend: Downtrend (already -13% in 2025)
- Position in Range: Testing key support zone

**Key Levels:**
- Resistance: $150, $158-160 (prior consolidation)
- Support: $136.79, $135.56, $134.79
- Breakdown Level: $134.50 (critical support failure)

**Structure Analysis:**
Already in distribution mode. The -13% move shows smart money has been exiting. Currently testing multi-level support cluster around $135-137. This is decision time - either bounces here or accelerates lower.

**Volume Read:**
Distribution pattern suggests institutional selling. Volume on down days likely heavier than bounce attempts.

**The Setup:**
SHORT Grade: **3/5** - Already moved, but not done
- Entry: Short any bounce to $145-150 resistance zone  
- Stop: $155 (above key resistance)
- Target: $120-125 (next major support cluster)

**Ant's Take:** "The easy money's been made, but this looks like a distribution top. Wait for the bounce to short into."

## KKR — Ant's Read

**Current Setup:**
- Price: ~$127-130 range (down 16% from ATH)
- Trend: Broken from January ATH of $170.40 
- Position in Range: Below key moving averages, failed breakdown

**Key Levels:**
- Resistance: $135, $145, $160 (step-up resistance)
- Support: $126-127 (current test zone)
- Breakdown Level: $125 (fails = acceleration)

**Structure Analysis:**
TEXTBOOK breakdown from ATH. Failed to hold the first major support and now testing critical $126-127 zone. The January $170 high was a blowoff top - classic distribution. Missed earnings catalyst confirmed the technical weakness.

**Volume Read:**
Heavy volume on the breakdown from ATH. This isn't a fake-out - institutions are dumping into liquidity.

**The Setup:**
SHORT Grade: **4/5** - Best setup of the three
- Entry: Short NOW at $127-130, add on any bounce to $135
- Stop: $140 (tight - this should NOT reclaim)
- Target 1: $115, Target 2: $100-105

**Ant's Take:** "This is what distribution looks like. The high was the high. Short every bounce until it proves otherwise."

## BX (Blackstone) — Ant's Read

**Current Setup:**
- Price: ~$140-145 (testing support at $136)
- Trend: Downtrend from premium highs
- Position in Range: At major support level

**Key Levels:**
- Resistance: $155, $170, $190 (staircase resistance)
- Support: $136 (CRITICAL), $125-130 (next cluster)
- Breakdown Level: $134 (support failure = big move)

**Structure Analysis:**
Premium valuation getting crushed but finding buyers at major support. $136 support has held multiple tests - this is institutional accumulation zone. However, at 60x P/E, any breakdown will be violent.

**Volume Read:**
Support tests show buying interest, but selling pressure remains heavy on bounces. Mixed signals.

**The Setup:**
SHORT Grade: **2/5** - Dangerous to short at support
- Entry: Only short a BREAK below $134 with volume
- Stop: $140 (tight - failed breakdown)
- Target: $115-120 (measured move from breakdown)

**Ant's Take:** "Support is support until it's not. Don't short the level - short the break. This one's tricky at current prices."

## The Verdict: BEST Short Setup

**KKR wins - Grade 4/5**

**Why KKR is the superior short:**
1. **Cleanest structure** - Broke from ATH with authority, no ambiguity
2. **Fundamental catalyst** - Missed Q4 EPS confirms technical weakness  
3. **Failed bounce** - Any rally to $135-140 is a gift to shorts
4. **Volume confirmation** - Heavy selling on breakdown, weak bounces
5. **Risk/Reward** - Tight stop at $140, big targets below $115

**Entry Strategy:**
- **Phase 1:** Short 50% position at current levels ($127-130)
- **Phase 2:** Add 25% on any bounce to $135 resistance  
- **Phase 3:** Final 25% if it reclaims $135 and fails at $140-145
- **Stop:** $140 - if it gets back above there, the breakdown failed
- **Targets:** $115 (1st), $100-105 (2nd)

**Timeline:** This setup works over 2-4 weeks. Not a day trade.

## Risk Management

**All three setups require:**
- Position sizing: Max 2% risk per trade
- Correlation risk: These move together - don't full-size all three
- Market risk: If SPY breaks down, these accelerate. If SPY rips, cover quickly.

**Watch for:** Any policy changes around private credit regulation that could spark violent covering rallies.

**Ant's final word:** "KKR broke clean. The others are still wrestling at key levels. Trade what's clear."
