## LONG CANDIDATES

### AI/Semiconductors
| Ticker | Grade | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| NVDA   | 3     | Phenomenal business, but priced for perfection - one slip and you're toast |
| AMD    | 4     | Finally got their act together, good alternative to Intel at reasonable price |
| MU     | 4     | Memory is cyclical but essential, trading at trough multiples |
| MRVL   | 3     | Decent data infrastructure play, but competition is fierce |
| PLTR   | 2     | Still burning cash after all these years, government contracts aren't a moat |

### Nuclear/Energy
| Ticker | Grade | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| CEG    | 5     | Clean nuclear fleet, regulated returns, essential baseload power |
| BEP    | 4     | Renewable infrastructure with long-term contracts, real cash flows |
| CCJ    | 3     | Uranium thesis makes sense, but commodity plays are coin flips |
| UEC    | 2     | Speculative uranium miner, no guaranteed production timeline |
| SMR    | 1     | Small modular reactors are decades away from meaningful revenue |

### Biotech
| Ticker | Grade | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| VRTX   | 5     | Dominant in rare diseases, pricing power, strong pipeline |
| REGN   | 4     | Proven drug developer with multiple blockbusters, solid FCF |
| SPRY   | 2     | Early-stage biotech, binary outcomes, not for value investors |
| KRYS   | 2     | Too early to judge, burning cash with hope for breakthrough |

## SHORT CANDIDATES

### Real Estate (REITs)
| Ticker | Grade | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| SLG    | 2     | NYC office space facing permanent WFH headwinds |
| VNO    | 2     | Manhattan office landlord, occupancy trending down |
| HIW    | 3     | Sunbelt office exposure better than NYC, but still challenged |
| BXP    | 2     | Boston office market weak, high debt levels concerning |

### Consumer Discretionary
| Ticker | Grade | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| PTON   | 1     | Fad product, unsustainable unit economics, declining subscriber base |
| FL     | 2     | Foot traffic declining, athletic wear competition intense |
| GME    | 1     | Retail apocalypse survivor with no clear digital strategy |

### Small/Mid Growth (Former Pandemic Winners)
| Ticker | Grade | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| ZM     | 3     | Decent business but growth pulled forward, competition increasing |
| PYPL   | 3     | Solid fintech franchise but Apple/Google eating market share |
| ROKU   | 2     | Streaming wars favor content owners, ROKU caught in middle |
| DOCU   | 2     | One-trick pony facing Microsoft competition, growth stalling |
| TDOC   | 1     | Telehealth hype fading, questionable unit economics |

## JEB'S TOP PICKS

### TOP 3 LONGS
1. **CEG (5)** - Nuclear power is having its moment, and these folks own the best fleet in America
2. **VRTX (5)** - When you own the only cure for rare diseases, you can charge whatever you want
3. **AMD (4)** - Finally eating Intel's lunch, and the market hasn't fully recognized it yet

### TOP 3 SHORTS  
1. **PTON (1)** - Exercise bikes at $2,000 a pop? This was always going to end badly
2. **SMR (1)** - Small modular reactors are science fiction dressed up as an investment
3. **GME (1)** - The meme is dead, the fundamentals were always awful

## FINAL THOUGHTS

*"This list tells a story about where we are in the cycle. Scout's found some real businesses trading at fair prices (the energy plays), some good companies that got ahead of themselves (NVDA, ZM), and some genuine dogs (PTON, GME). The uranium speculation reminds me of the dot-com bubble - lots of hope, not much cash flow. Stick with the businesses that make money today, not tomorrow."*
