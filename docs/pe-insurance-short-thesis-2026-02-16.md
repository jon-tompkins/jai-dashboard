# PE-Insurance Short Thesis - Scout Report

**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Thesis:** Private equity firms bought insurers and stuffed them with mis-rated private credit  
**Source:** TotemMacro/Lyn Alden chart showing PE-owned insurance assets: ~$100B (2018) → $1,200B+ (2025)

## Thesis Summary

**The Claim is TRUE.** Private equity has systematically acquired insurance companies to create captive pools of capital for their private credit strategies. These insurers are loaded with hard-to-value, potentially mis-rated private credit assets that could blow up if credit deteriorates or rates stay elevated.

**The Model:** PE firms buy life insurers → stuff balance sheets with private credit → use higher yields to offer competitive annuity rates → grow AUM rapidly → extract fees on both sides

**The Risk:** When private credit hits trouble, insurers can't easily liquidate. If annuity holders demand withdrawals or regulators demand higher capital, the whole model breaks.

## Evidence FOR Mis-Rating Concerns

### 1. **Regulatory Red Flags**
- **NAIC raising capital requirements** for private credit investments (effective 2025)
- **Securities Valuation Office (SVO)** now requiring enhanced scrutiny on private letter ratings
- **"Private Ratings Among U.S. Insurer Bond Investments Continue to Rise and Have Nearly Tripled in Five Years"** - NAIC report (later removed from website)
- New rules allow regulators to **override automatic ratings** on investments

### 2. **Structural Issues**
- **Level 3 Assets (mark-to-model)** heavily represented in private credit portfolios
- **Rating agency conflicts** - same agencies rating deals they help structure
- **Valuation uncertainty and liquidity challenges** flagged by International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS)
- **"Liability management exercises"** masking distress (restructurings instead of defaults)

### 3. **Stress Indicators**
- Private credit default rates: **5.2% in October 2025** (Fitch) - trending down but still elevated
- **S&P high-yield default rate above 4%** through September 2025
- Apollo stock down **12.9% over 1-year** (through late 2025)
- BofA warns private credit remains **"among the most fragile parts of the U.S. credit market"**

## The Players - Who Owns What

|---------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Apollo** | **Athene** | $200B+ reinsurance | 96% from Bermuda, biggest U.S. annuity issuer |
| **KKR** | **Global Atlantic** | $158B AUM | Full acquisition completed Jan 2024 for $2.7B |

## Top 5 Short Candidates

### 1. **Apollo Global (APO) - PRIMARY TARGET**
**Why:** Biggest exposure, most levered to the model
- **Athene = ~50% of Apollo's business** 
- Stock already showing stress (-12.9% in 2025)
- Massive Bermuda reinsurance concentration (96%)
- Heavy private credit loading across portfolio

### 2. **KKR & Co (KKR)**
**Why:** Just went all-in on Global Atlantic
- Spent $2.7B to acquire remaining 37% in 2024
- **Missed Q4 2025 EPS estimates** 
- Global Atlantic critical to fee generation model
- High conviction bet on insurance model

### 3. **Athene (AHL) - DIRECT PLAY**
**Why:** Pure-play insurance vehicle with maximum private credit exposure
- Directly owned by Apollo, most exposed to credit stress
- 96% Bermuda reinsurance creates regulatory risk
- Annuity withdrawal pressure if yields compress
- Balance sheet opacity around Level 3 assets

### 4. **Blackstone (BX)**
**Why:** Integrated model creates concentrated risk
- New BXCI integration puts insurance at center of strategy
- Massive scale means bigger potential blowup
- Stock trades at premium valuation vulnerable to model breakdown

### 5. **Global Atlantic (Private) + KKR Credit Funds**
**Why:** If you can't short GA directly, target KKR credit vehicles
- BCRED (Blackstone Credit) and similar BDCs as proxy plays
- Non-traded BDCs showing NAV pressure
- Credit fund performance directly impacts insurance model

## Key Triggers to Watch

### 1. **Credit Cycle Turn** 
- Default rates above 6-7% would stress private credit portfolios
- Covenant breaches forcing mark-downs
- "Liability management exercises" failing to work

### 2. **Interest Rate Environment**
- **Rising rates:** Annuity surrender pressure, higher funding costs
- **Falling rates:** Spread compression, harder to offer competitive rates

### 3. **Regulatory Action**
- NAIC capital requirement increases
- State insurance commissioners restricting private credit allocations
- SEC scrutiny of BDC valuations

### 4. **Liquidity Events**
- Large annuity redemptions forcing asset sales
- Insurance company downgrades requiring additional capital
- Flight-to-quality out of private credit

### 5. **Market Sentiment Shift**
- Analyst downgrades on PE firms' insurance strategies  
- Media focus on "shadow banking" risks
- Rating agency methodology changes

---

## Counter-Arguments (Why This Might NOT Work)

### 1. **Model Has Worked So Far**
- Strong performance since 2018
- Insurers generating attractive spreads
- Default rates still manageable vs. historical norms

### 2. **Diversification Benefits**
- Private credit often less correlated with public markets
- Multiple vintage years smooth returns
- Professional management vs. public bond portfolios

### 3. **Regulatory Capture**
- Insurance commissioners understand the model
- NAIC changes may be incremental, not disruptive
- Bermuda regulatory arbitrage remains viable

### 4. **Too Big to Fail**
- Combined $1.2T in assets creates systemic importance
- Bailouts more likely than failures
- Political pressure to protect annuity holders

### 5. **Interest Rate Tailwinds**
- Higher rates benefit new originations
- Credit quality may improve as economy stabilizes
- Spreads remain attractive vs. alternatives

## Scout's Take

**This is a structural short, not a timing play.** The PE-insurance complex has grown too big, too fast, with too much private credit concentrated in vehicles designed for stable, liquid assets. 

**Best approach:** Start with Apollo/Athene as the purest play, then layer in KKR. Watch for credit stress triggers in H2 2026 as more private credit vintages from 2021-2022 hit maturity walls.

**Conviction: HIGH** - The math doesn't work long-term. When private credit hits a real cycle, these insurance companies will be holding the bag with limited liquidity and growing redemption pressure.

**Risk Management:** This could take time to play out. Size positions appropriately and watch for early warning signals in BDC NAVs and credit fund performance.
