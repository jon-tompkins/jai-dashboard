## Individual Position Analysis

### 1. BEP (Brookfield Renewable) - Grade: 4/5
**Current:** $31.77 | **Cost:** $29.48 | **P&L:** +7.8%

**Verdict:** HOLD/ADD on pullback

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $30.00, $29.00, $25.00 (major)
- Resistance: $32.50, $35.00

**Current Structure:**
Breaking out of descending channel. Held $25 support beautifully during the washout - that's what smart money accumulation looks like. Volume confirmed the bounce from key support. Currently testing overhead resistance around $32.

**Ant's Take:** Quality base built. Let it digest the move, add on any pullback to $29-30 zone.

---

### 2. INTC (Intel) - Grade: 4/5
**Current:** $46.79 | **Cost:** $40.45 | **P&L:** +15.7%

**Verdict:** HOLD

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $44.00, $40.00 (cost basis)
- Resistance: $48.00, $52.00

**Current Structure:**
Strong uptrend intact. Price above all key moving averages with buying pressure evident. The move from $40 shows institutional accumulation. Currently in a healthy pullback within the uptrend.

**Ant's Take:** Structure is clean. Hold the position - this baby's got legs.

---

### 3. OXY (Occidental Petroleum) - Grade: 4/5
**Current:** $46.07 | **Cost:** $46.85 | **P&L:** -1.7%

**Verdict:** HOLD/ADD

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $45.00, $42.50
- Resistance: $48.00, $50.00

**Current Structure:**
Strongly bullish trend. Price above 5, 20 & 50 EMAs with buying pressure. The slight underperformance vs cost basis is noise - the structure says accumulation is happening here.

**Ant's Take:** Oil charts don't lie. This is building energy for the next leg higher.

---

### 4. XPRO (Expro Group) - Grade: 3/5
**Current:** $16.33 | **Cost:** $16.44 | **P&L:** -0.7%

**Verdict:** HOLD

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $15.50, $14.00
- Resistance: $17.50, $19.00

**Current Structure:**
Sideways consolidation around cost basis. Not much to get excited about technically - classic range-bound action. Needs volume to break either way.

**Ant's Take:** Boring is fine. Hold and wait for direction.

---

### 5. ONDS (Ondas Holdings) - Grade: 3/5
**Current:** $9.31 | **Cost:** $9.39 | **P&L:** -0.9%

**Verdict:** HOLD

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $8.50, $7.00
- Resistance: $10.00, $12.00

**Current Structure:**
Small-cap chop around fair value. Recent strength suggests someone's accumulating, but needs to prove itself above $10 resistance.

**Ant's Take:** Small caps need patience. Structure isn't broken, hold your horses.

---

### 6. NNE (Nano Nuclear) - Grade: 2/5
**Current:** $24.79 | **Cost:** $26.54 | **P&L:** -6.6%

**Verdict:** HOLD/TRIM on bounce

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $22.00, $18.00
- Resistance: $27.00, $30.00

**Current Structure:**
Classic small-cap momentum stock losing steam. The move from IPO highs is retracing - needs to hold $22 support or it gets ugly fast.

**Ant's Take:** Momentum's gone. If it bounces to $27, consider trimming half.

---

### 7. DNN (Denison Mines) - Grade: 2/5
**Current:** $3.78 | **Cost:** $4.18 | **P&L:** -9.6%

**Verdict:** HOLD/ADD if breaks below $3.69

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $3.69 (accumulated volume), $3.20
- Resistance: $4.20, $4.80

**Current Structure:**
Uranium trade cooling off. Key support at $3.69 from accumulated volume - this is your line in the sand. Recent 3% down days suggest distribution.

**Ant's Take:** Support test coming. If it holds $3.69, reload. If it breaks, cut losses.

---

### 8. UUUU (Energy Fuels) - Grade: 2/5
**Current:** $20.72 | **Cost:** $22.30 | **P&L:** -7.1%

**Verdict:** HOLD

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $19.50, $17.00
- Resistance: $23.00, $25.00

**Current Structure:**
Another uranium name under pressure. Earnings coming Feb 27 - that's your catalyst. Structure shows consolidation but needs volume.

**Ant's Take:** Earnings play. Hold through the event, reassess after.

---

### 9. LAC (Lithium Americas) - Grade: 3/5
**Current:** $4.63 | **Cost:** $5.79 | **P&L:** -20.0%

**Verdict:** ADD (contrarian)

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $4.50, $4.00
- Resistance: $5.00, $5.75

**Current Structure:**
**This is the gem.** Trading in broad accumulation zone $4.75-$5.00. Early signs of reversal after prolonged downtrend. Smart money's building positions here.

**Ant's Take:** Lithium's been left for dead. That's when you buy. Add to the position.

---

### 10. PURR - Grade: 1/5
**Current:** $4.32 | **Cost:** $4.57 | **P&L:** -5.5%

**Verdict:** EXIT on bounce

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $4.00, $3.50
- Resistance: $4.70, $5.20

**Current Structure:**
Weak technical picture. No institutional interest visible. Looks like retail speculation that's running out of steam.

**Ant's Take:** Dead money. Exit on any bounce toward $4.50-4.70.

---

### 11. TAKOF - Grade: 1/5
**Current:** $0.38 | **Cost:** $0.43 | **P&L:** -11.6%

**Verdict:** EXIT

**Key Levels:**
- Support: $0.35, $0.30
- Resistance: $0.45, $0.50

**Current Structure:**
Penny stock death spiral. No volume, no interest, no structure. This is gambling, not investing.

**Ant's Take:** Cut it loose. Life's too short for bad charts.

---

## Portfolio Overview

### Best Charts:
1. **LAC** - Accumulation zone, contrarian opportunity
2. **BEP** - Clean breakout from base
3. **INTC** - Strong uptrend, institutional backing
4. **OXY** - Oil sector leadership

### In Trouble Technically:
- **TAKOF** - Penny stock spiral
- **PURR** - No institutional interest
- **NNE** - Momentum fading
- **DNN** - Testing key support

### Immediate Attention Needed:
1. **DNN** - Watch $3.69 support test
2. **NNE** - Consider trimming on any bounce to $27
3. **TAKOF** - Exit position
4. **PURR** - Exit on bounce

### Action Plan:
- **ADD:** LAC (accumulation opportunity)
- **HOLD:** BEP, INTC, OXY, XPRO, ONDS, DNN (if support holds), UUUU (through earnings)
- **TRIM:** NNE (on bounce)
- **EXIT:** TAKOF, PURR

---

**Final Ant Take:**
Your uranium theme is under pressure but that's normal after big runs. LAC is your best risk/reward here - classic accumulation setup. Tech (INTC) and energy (OXY, BEP) are your structural winners. Cut the dead weight (TAKOF, PURR) and focus on quality.

The market's telling you something - listen to it.
