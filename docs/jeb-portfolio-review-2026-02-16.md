# Jon's Equity Portfolio Review - Jeb's Take
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Portfolio Value:** $30,290 (1.5% of total $2M portfolio)

---

## Executive Summary

Son, you've got $30k scattered across 11 equity positions that look like they were picked by throwing darts at a uranium mining convention. Heavy concentration in energy/uranium theme with position sizes so small they couldn't move the needle if they doubled overnight. Some interesting businesses mixed with pure speculation. Here's what I see:

## Position-by-Position Analysis

### BEP (Brookfield Renewable) - $2,859 | 90 shares
**Grade: 4/5** | **Verdict: HOLD**

Brookfield knows how to run infrastructure assets. This partnership owns renewable energy projects across multiple geographies with long-term power purchase agreements. Recent FFO growth looks solid at $794M for 2024, up from $716M prior year. The 5.3% distribution yield is attractive and they just announced a 5% increase. Management has a proven track record of capital allocation.

**Key Risk:** Interest rate sensitivity on infrastructure valuations. Rising rates compress multiples for yield-oriented assets.

### XPRO (Expro Group) - $7,348 | 450 shares  
**Grade: 3/5** | **Verdict: HOLD**

Oilfield services company generating $1.7B revenue with ~20% EBITDA margins. They're doing what you want to see - buying back stock (1.2M shares in Q4 2024) and improving margins. The business is cyclical and tied to oil capital spending, but at least they're generating cash. Trading at reasonable levels given the leverage in their model.

**Key Risk:** Oil capex cycle turns down. These services companies get crushed when drilling activity slows.

### DNN (Denison Mines) - $1,890 | 500 shares
**Grade: 2/5** | **Verdict: TRIM**

Pre-production uranium development story with the Phoenix ISR project. They're making progress (65% completion of engineering) but this is still a bet on future uranium prices, not current cash flows. Had a nice $134M gain on their physical uranium holdings, which tells you they're as much a uranium trading operation as a mining company.

**Key Risk:** Project development delays, uranium price volatility, regulatory hurdles in Saskatchewan.

### UUUU (Energy Fuels) - $5,180 | 250 shares
**Grade: 3/5** | **Verdict: HOLD**

One of the few U.S. uranium producers actually mining and processing material. They've diversified into rare earth elements, which shows some strategic thinking. The business generates real revenue from uranium, rare earth, and heavy mineral sand sales. Much prefer this to the development-stage plays.

**Key Risk:** Commodity price cycles for both uranium and rare earths. Chinese rare earth competition.

### PURR (Hyperliquid Strategies) - $2,160 | 500 shares  
**Grade: 1/5** | **Verdict: SELL**

This is crypto speculation dressed up as a biotech company. Recent business combination turned this into a "digital asset treasury company" focused on HYPE token exposure. I don't know what HYPE is, and neither do you. This isn't investing, it's gambling.

**Key Risk:** Total loss of capital. This is pure speculation on crypto tokens.

### INTC (Intel) - $2,901 | 62 shares
**Grade: 3/5** | **Verdict: HOLD**

The foundry strategy might work, but Intel's been promising a comeback for years. They're burning cash trying to compete with TSMC while their core CPU business faces pressure from AMD and ARM. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan knows semiconductors, which is encouraging. Trading at distressed levels for a reason.

**Key Risk:** Foundry strategy fails, competition intensifies, geopolitical risks around chip manufacturing.

### LAC (Lithium Americas) - $1,852 | 400 shares
**Grade: 2/5** | **Verdict: SELL**  

Another pre-production development story, this time in lithium. The Thacker Pass project faces environmental challenges and permitting delays. Lithium prices have collapsed from their highs, making the economics questionable. You're down 20% for good reason.

**Key Risk:** Permitting delays, lithium price weakness, project development costs exceeding projections.

### NNE (Nano Nuclear Energy) - $1,363 | 55 shares
**Grade: 1/5** | **Verdict: SELL**

Small modular reactor story with no revenue and questionable prospects. The nuclear power renaissance is real, but it'll be won by established players with regulatory approval, not startups promising miracle technology. This smells like the clean energy SPAC bubble all over again.

**Key Risk:** Technology never materializes, regulatory approval impossible, total loss likely.

### OXY (Occidental Petroleum) - $2,304 | 50 shares  
**Grade: 4/5** | **Verdict: ADD**

If it's good enough for Warren Buffett's 29% stake, it's worth considering. Strong cash flow generation ($3B operating, $1.3B free cash flow), focused on U.S. shale plays, and they're investing in carbon capture technology. CEO Vicki Hollub has been disciplined about capital allocation.

**Key Risk:** Oil price volatility, but Oxy has one of the better cost structures in the Permian Basin.

### ONDS (Ondas Holdings) - $1,862 | 200 shares
**Grade: 2/5** | **Verdict: SELL**

Industrial IoT and radio solutions company that's too small and niche to build sustainable competitive advantages. These technology plays need scale to survive, and ONDS doesn't have it.

**Key Risk:** Larger competitors squeeze out small players, technology becomes commoditized.

### TAKOF (Volatus Aerospace) - $570 | 1500 shares
**Grade: 1/5** | **Verdict: SELL** 

Canadian drone services company trading at $0.38/share. The commercial drone market is crowded with low barriers to entry. This position is so small it's not worth the mental energy to track.

**Key Risk:** Business never achieves scale, competitive pressures, regulatory changes.

## Portfolio Construction Issues

### Concentration Risks
**The Uranium Problem:** Between DNN, UUUU, NNE, and the URA options, you've got massive concentration in nuclear/uranium. If that theme goes sour, multiple positions get hit simultaneously.

**Size Problems:** Your largest position is $7,348. These aren't position sizes that can create wealth - they're token amounts that create tracking overhead without meaningful impact.

### What's Missing

**Quality at Scale:** You need fewer, larger positions in higher-quality businesses. Instead of 11 tiny positions, consider 4-5 meaningful ones.

**Dividend Growers:** Only BEP pays a meaningful dividend. Where are the quality dividend-growing companies?

**Defensive Characteristics:** This portfolio gets destroyed in a recession. Everything here is cyclical or speculative.

**Geographic Diversification:** Heavy U.S./Canada focus with commodity exposure.

## The Bottom Line

This looks like a collection of themes rather than a thoughtfully constructed portfolio. The uranium bet might work, but you're making it with 4+ different names instead of picking the 1-2 best ones. The position sizes are too small to matter, and half these companies shouldn't be in a serious portfolio.

**My Recommendations:**
1. **SELL:** PURR, NNE, LAC, ONDS, TAKOF (clean out the junk)
2. **TRIM:** DNN (reduce uranium concentration) 
3. **ADD:** OXY (quality business, Buffett backing)
4. **HOLD:** BEP, XPRO, UUUU, INTC (monitor closely)

**Going Forward:** Pick 4-5 quality businesses you understand, buy meaningful positions, and stop chasing every theme that crosses your screen. Position size matters more than number of positions.

Remember: It's better to own a few outstanding businesses at reasonable prices than a collection of average ones at any price.
