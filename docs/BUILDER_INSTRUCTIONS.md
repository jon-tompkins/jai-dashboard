## IMPORTANT: Reviews Tab Already Exists!

There's already a Reviews tab in the dashboard that shows tweet drafts.

**DO NOT CREATE A NEW REVIEWS TAB**

Instead:
1. **Extend the existing Reviews tab** 
2. **Add "Task Deliverables" section** alongside tweet drafts
3. **Keep existing tweet draft functionality** intact
4. **Add task cards** for completed deliverables (Plaid, MyJunto Scheduling, etc.)

**Goal**: Integrate task reviews into existing Reviews interface, don't replace it.

This file can be deleted after the task is complete.
