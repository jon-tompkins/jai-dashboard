# Task Reviews & Deliverables

This folder contains completed work from sub-agents, organized for easy review and testing.

## Folder Structure

Each completed task gets its own subfolder with:
- **Code/files** - All deliverable code and assets
- **README.md** - Overview of what was built
- **TESTING.md** - How to test/deploy the deliverables  
- **REVIEW.md** - Summary for Jon to review

## Current Deliverables

### ✅ Plaid Integration (Task: e21c7637)
- **Location**: `./plaid-integration/` (full Next.js app)
- **Status**: Ready to test
- **Key files**: Complete portfolio tracking app with Supabase integration

### ✅ MyJunto Custom Scheduling (Task: i3j4k5l6)  
- **Location**: Various files in `jai-dashboard/` + `supabase_scheduling_system.sql`
- **Status**: Deployed to GitHub, needs SQL migration
- **Key files**: API endpoints, frontend UI, database schema

## For Future Sub-Agents

**When completing tasks:**
1. Create folder: `reviews/TASK-NAME/`
2. Copy all deliverables to that folder
3. Include README.md with overview
4. Include TESTING.md with setup instructions
5. Ping Jon that deliverables are ready for review in `reviews/TASK-NAME/`

This ensures Jon can always find completed work in one organized place.
