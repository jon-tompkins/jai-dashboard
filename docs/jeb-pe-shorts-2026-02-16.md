# PE-Insurance SHORT Analysis
*Jeb's Take - February 16, 2026*

**The Thesis:** PE firms bought insurers and stuffed them with mis-rated private credit. When credit cycles turn, these balance sheets could blow up.

**Market Context:** Private credit defaults rising to 5.9% (leveraged loans), up from 2020-2023 lows. Credit cycle turning, but most folks still in denial.

## 1. APO (Apollo Global) — Grade: 4/5 SHORT

**The Business:** Apollo's a $700B+ asset manager that went all-in on insurance when they bought Athene. Now Athene represents 50% of their business, and it's stuffed with Apollo's own private credit deals. Classic conflict of interest dressed up as "synergy."

**Why It's Vulnerable:**
Apollo's got the biggest insurance exposure of the three, with Athene handling $200B+ in assets. Here's the kicker - 96% of their reinsurance is domiciled in Bermuda, where regulatory oversight is lighter than my morning coffee. They're basically running a captive that buys their own paper at inflated prices. When credit goes south (and it's already started with defaults at 5.9%), Athene's book is gonna look uglier than a bear market. The stock's already down 13% in 2025 - smart money's getting nervous.

**Key Red Flags:**
- Athene = 50% of total business (concentration risk)
- 96% Bermuda reinsurance (regulatory arbitrage)
- Heavy exposure to Apollo's own private credit deals
- Insurance reserves may be under-reserved for credit cycle
- Stock already showing weakness (-13% in 2025)

**Fair Value if Thesis Plays Out:** $85-95 (currently ~$133)
*Insurance book gets marked down 20-30%, multiple compression on earnings quality concerns*

## 2. KKR — Grade: 5/5 SHORT

**The Business:** KKR just went full retard by paying $2.7B for the remaining 37% of Global Atlantic they didn't already own. That's buying at the top of the cycle when credit's already showing cracks. They missed Q4 EPS too - never a good sign when you're levering up.

**Why It's Vulnerable:**
This is the dumbest move of the three. KKR paid top dollar ($2.7B cash) for the rest of Global Atlantic RIGHT as the credit cycle's turning. That's like buying flood insurance during a hurricane. They're now 100% exposed to Global Atlantic's balance sheet, which is loaded with KKR's own credit deals. Missing Q4 earnings while doubling down on insurance exposure? That's management hubris at its finest. When their private credit book starts showing losses, there's no minority shareholder to absorb the pain anymore - it's all KKR's problem.

**Key Red Flags:**
- Bought remaining 37% stake at peak valuations ($2.7B cash)
- Missed Q4 2024 earnings expectations
- Now 100% exposed to Global Atlantic's credit risk
- Timing couldn't be worse - credit cycle turning
- High leverage from acquisition just as defaults rising

**Fair Value if Thesis Plays Out:** $65-75 (need current price)
*Massive writedowns on Global Atlantic book, acquisition proves massively value-destructive*

## 3. BX (Blackstone) — Grade: 3/5 SHORT

**The Business:** Blackstone's playing the same game but being smarter about it. They created BXCI (Blackstone Credit & Insurance) and are targeting $1 trillion in AUM. Premium valuation but more diversified than the other two clowns.

**Why It's Less Vulnerable (But Still Risky):**
Blackstone's got the best execution of the three, but they're still playing with fire. BXCI is newer and smaller relative to their total business compared to Apollo's Athene exposure. They've also got more fee-based revenue from their other segments (real estate, private equity). The $1 trillion target sounds impressive until you realize they're planning to get there by stuffing more insurance companies with illiquid credit. Still trades at a premium multiple that assumes everything goes perfectly.

**Key Red Flags:**
- BXCI integration still early stages (execution risk)
- Premium valuation assumes no credit issues
- $1T AUM target requires aggressive growth in insurance
- Still playing the same stuffing-insurers-with-credit game

**Fair Value if Thesis Plays Out:** $110-120 (need current price)
*Multiple compression but better diversification limits downside*

## The Verdict: KKR is the BEST SHORT

**Why KKR Wins the Short Contest:**

1. **Worst Timing:** Paid $2.7B for Global Atlantic at the peak
2. **100% Exposure:** No minority shareholders to share the pain  
3. **Already Missing Numbers:** Q4 earnings miss shows cracks forming
4. **Highest Leverage:** Just took on debt to buy Global Atlantic as credit turns
5. **Pure Play:** Less diversification than Blackstone to cushion losses

KKR management just made the classic mistake - doubling down at the top of the cycle. When Global Atlantic's book gets marked down (and it will), every dollar of loss hits KKR's equity. Apollo's got similar problems but at least they've been in the insurance game longer. Blackstone's playing it smarter with better diversification.

**The Play:** Short KKR first, then Apollo. Blackstone's the least attractive short of the three - still risky but better managed.

*Jeb's Final Word:* "I've seen this movie before, son. PE boys think they're smarter than credit cycles. They never are. KKR just bet the farm on insurance at the worst possible time. When the tide goes out, we'll see who's been swimming naked."
