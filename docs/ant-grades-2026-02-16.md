3. **SLG (4)** - Downtrend structure intact, any bounce = short entry

## ANT'S TAKE

The longs are cleaner than the shorts right now. Energy rotation is real - CEG and UEC have institutional footprints all over them. KRYS is a pure technical play - small float, breakout pattern, smart money loading.

On shorts, REIT breakdown patterns are textbook. VNO broke 20-year support - that's not coming back anytime soon. DOCU bear flag is a thing of beauty.

Avoid the meme garbage (GME) and the already-dead (PTON). Charts don't lie - structure tells you everything.

**Structure over story. Always.**
