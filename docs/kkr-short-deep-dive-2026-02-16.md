# KKR Short Deep Dive — Scout Report
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Target:** KKR & Co. Inc. (NYSE: KKR)  
**Current Price:** ~$99-105  
**ATH:** $170.40 (January 31, 2025)  
**Recommendation Grade:** A+ SHORT CANDIDATE  

---

## Executive Summary

KKR is exhibiting classic late-cycle PE stress with a leveraged bet on Global Atlantic going wrong at exactly the wrong time. The $2.7B acquisition at the top, combined with private credit exposure through the insurance model, creates a perfect storm for continued weakness. This has all the makings of a high-probability short with defined risk levels.

**Scout's Take:** *"PE giants drunk on cheap money are getting their faces ripped off as the cycle turns. KKR doubled down on insurance right as private credit starts showing cracks. This one's got legs to the downside."*

## 1. The Business — Structure & Fee Model

### Core Business Lines
1. **Asset Management** (Traditional PE/Credit)
2. **Strategic Holdings** (Balance sheet investments)
3. **Insurance** (Global Atlantic - the crown jewel)

### The KKR Machine
- **AUM:** $638 billion (up 15% YoY through Q4 2024)
- **Fee-paying AUM:** $512 billion (up 15% YoY)
- **Management Fees:** $906M in Q4 alone (up 15% YoY)
- **Fee-Related Earnings (FRE):** The stable recurring revenue stream

### Global Atlantic's Critical Role
- **Insurance float** provides permanent capital for investments
- **Fee multiplier effect:** Every $1 of dry powder can generate $10+ of fee-paying AUM
- **Private credit allocation:** Heavy exposure to KKR's own credit strategies
- **Annuity business:** $1 trillion industry-wide, but rate-sensitive

**The Problem:** This model works beautifully in a rising rate environment with expanding spreads. But when credit tightens and defaults rise, the insurance book becomes a liability, not an asset.

## 2. Financial Snapshot — The Numbers Don't Lie

| Metric | Q4 2024 | Trend | Scout Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Revenue** | $3.26B | Mixed | Strong top line, weak bottom line |
| **EPS (Adjusted)** | $1.27 | ❌ MISS | Below $1.41 estimate |
| **AUM** | $638B | ↑ 15% | Growth slowing vs. 19% prior |
| **Fee Income** | $1.3B | ↑ 17% | Offset by rising expenses |
| **Expenses** | $2.98B | ↑ Rising | Margin compression story |

### Key Ratios & Health Metrics
- **Balance Sheet Cash:** $23B+ (used for Global Atlantic acquisition)
- **Fee Margin Pressure:** Revenue growth not dropping to bottom line
- **Capital Deployment:** Record $84B in 2024, but at peak valuations

**Red Flag:** Growing expenses faster than fee growth = margin compression narrative

---

## 3. Global Atlantic Deep Dive — The Achilles Heel

### Asset Base & Allocation
- **Total Insurance AUM:** Substantial portion of the $638B total
- **Private Credit Heavy:** Direct lending, asset-based finance, specialty credit
- **Illiquid Exposure:** Can't easily mark-to-market or exit positions
- **Duration Risk:** Long-tail liabilities funded by illiquid credit

### The Private Credit Time Bomb
- **$6+ trillion ABF market** (larger than syndicated loans + HY combined)
- **No defaults yet** but market "facing its first big test" in 2026
- **Rising rates stress** on leveraged borrowers with tight FCF
- **KKR's own admission:** "Higher defaults" if inflation flares

### Insurance Industry Headwinds
- **Annuity sensitivity** to rate cycles
- **Regulatory scrutiny** increasing on PE-insurance models
- **Liquidity mismatches** between assets and liabilities
- **Competition intensifying** from traditional insurers

## 5. The Short Thesis — Why This Goes Lower

### Primary Drivers
1. **Overpaid for Global Atlantic** at the cycle peak ($2.7B timing couldn't be worse)
2. **Private credit exposure** through insurance book creates asymmetric downside
3. **Fee growth slowing** while expenses accelerate (margin compression)
4. **Regulatory risk** on PE-insurance model gaining traction
5. **Liquidity concerns** if insurance book needs to delever

### Catalysts for Further Downside
- **Q1 2026 earnings** likely to show continued pressure
- **First meaningful defaults** in private credit portfolios
- **Insurance redemption pressures** from policyholders
- **Regulatory action** on PE-insurance structures
- **Rising rates** stress on portfolio companies
- **Economic slowdown** triggering broad credit stress

### The Feedback Loop
Insurance book weakness → Lower AUM → Reduced fees → Margin pressure → Multiple compression → Stock falls → Balance sheet stress → Insurance book weakness

## 6. Technical Levels — Entry, Stop, Targets

### Current Technical Picture
- **Recent High:** $170.40 (January 31, 2025)
- **Current Range:** $99-105
- **Breakdown:** Clean break below all major moving averages

### Short Setup Levels
- **Resistance:** $140 (Ant's call looks spot on)
  - Failed breakout level becomes resistance
  - Key psychological level for institutions
- **Entry Zone:** $105-110 on any bounce
- **Stop Loss:** $142 (above resistance breakdown)
- **Target 1:** $115 (next support level)
- **Target 2:** $100-105 (Ant's target zone - already testing)
- **Extended Target:** $85-90 (2023 lows if credit cycle turns)

### Risk-Reward
- Entry at $107, stop at $142, target $95 = 2.5:1 R/R
- **Favorable setup** with defined risk and multiple catalysts

## 7. Position Sizing — How to Structure the Trade

### Recommended Approach
- **Core Position:** 1-2% of capital via equity short
- **Enhanced Returns:** Put spreads (buy $100 puts, sell $80 puts)
- **Timing:** 3-6 month horizon for next major move
- **Scale-In Strategy:** Add on bounces toward $120-130 resistance

### Options Strategy
- **Bear Put Spread:** Long $110 puts / Short $90 puts (3-6 month expiry)
- **Naked Puts:** Buy $95 puts if conviction is high
- **Call Spreads:** Sell $120/$140 call spreads on bounces

### Risk Management

## 8. Risk to Short — What Could Go Wrong

### Bull Case Scenarios
1. **Private credit proves resilient** (no defaults materialize)
2. **Insurance business stabilizes** (annuity demand holds up)
3. **Fee growth reaccelerates** (margin concerns overblown)
4. **Market multiple expansion** (asset managers get re-rated)
5. **Activist involvement** (forces strategic alternatives)

### Squeeze Potential
- **Analyst targets $148-155** suggest oversold conditions
- **High institutional ownership** could create covering rallies
- **Low float** if buy-and-hold institutions don't sell
- **Earnings surprise** to upside could trigger violent short squeeze

### Technical Risks
- **$100 level** is major psychological support
- **Oversold bounce** could run to $120-130 quickly
- **Broad market rally** could lift all asset managers

### Fundamental Risks
- **Global Atlantic performance** better than expected
- **Private credit default rates** remain contained
- **Regulatory clarity** removes overhang
- **Strategic buyer interest** (break-up value play)

## 9. Bull Case — Why Shorts Could Get Burned

### The Optimistic View
1. **Best-in-class franchise** with permanent capital advantage
2. **Global Atlantic integration** creates unique value
3. **Private credit leadership** in growing market
4. **Fee model resilience** through cycles
5. **Balance sheet strength** to deploy opportunistically

### Potential Positive Catalysts
- **Strong Q1 2026 results** showing margin expansion
- **Large strategic transaction** boosting fees
- **Private credit performance** exceeding expectations
- **Activist pressure** for value realization
- **Dividend increase** or special distribution
- **Strategic alternatives** (spin-offs, sales)

### Valuation Argument
- **Trading below historical multiples** vs. asset management peers
- **Fee stream quality** commands premium valuation
- **Growth potential** still intact despite cyclical headwinds
- **Book value support** around current levels

## Scout's Investment Conclusion

**Grade: A+ Short Candidate**  
**Conviction: High**  
**Time Horizon: 3-6 months**  

This setup has everything you want in a short:
- ✅ **Late-cycle leverage** (Global Atlantic acquisition timing)
- ✅ **Structural headwinds** (private credit risk, insurance model stress)
- ✅ **Technical breakdown** (clean break from $170 highs)
- ✅ **Fundamental deterioration** (margin compression)
- ✅ **Catalyst pipeline** (earnings, credit stress, regulatory risk)
- ✅ **Defined risk levels** ($140 resistance)

**The Trade:** Short KKR on bounces to $105-110, target $95-100, stop $142.

**Scout's Bottom Line:** *"KKR is the poster child for late-cycle PE hubris. They paid top dollar for Global Atlantic right as the credit cycle peaks, and now they're stuck with insurance book full of illiquid private credit just as defaults are about to spike. This one's got room to run on the downside - the margin compression story is real, and the technical breakdown is clean. Risk-reward favors the bears here."*
